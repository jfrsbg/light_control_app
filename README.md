# Light Control App

<p>This is an ongoing flutter project that I decided to start and keep adding
new features to it.</p>

<p>First of all, the design wasn't made by myself, I'm a programmer and not a designer, that's why I
get this free XD Template on internet and started to work with it</p>

<p>You can download the XD project <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/7849062-Smart-lights-Free-Adobe-XD">here</a> and compare
with what I was able to do using flutter. I'm improving and adding new things to fit my ideas, but the XD was my starting point</p>

<p>The main idea was just replicate the layout on flutter, but then I realized that I can make a great IoT project
for my house. I know that are many apps out there with the same purpose, but I really want to make my own</p>

<p>This is an open source project, so, feel free to send pull requests and add more features</p>

<p>I'm thinking about add support for Xiaomi Yeelight and other Smart Lights that have a SDK, but first I need to finish the main idea of the app</p>

# How to execute
<p>Just clone the repository, run the ```flutter pub get``` command and run the project</p>
